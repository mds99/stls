I've built a small ('companion') corexy printer using scrap i've got on hands. 

Frame of 12mm plywood, router cut.
Uses some aluminum parts for gantry, like 20x20 square tube and angle elements. 
So heavy file work or milling machine is required to build it. 

with 150x150x150 print volume it's able to produce any part for bigger machines. 
Due to over-built frame and 9mm THK linear guides i've got suddenly  a quite sturdy machine. 
It's capable to run on high velocity and acceleration even with arduino electronics. 

The machine is quite compact, but heavy. 
It allows to work with flexible filaments (flex, rubber) thanks to modified geared 'almost direct' wade extruder. 
I had to implement custom heating bed using 220v ceramic heater and SSR module on bottom of thick aluminum plate.

All customized parts for this build included.
