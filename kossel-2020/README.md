I've got a partly assembled Kossel frame on 2020 profile from a friend. 
Besides it's originally flimsy frame i like this machine style for its robust and quiet operation, so i decided to finish his build. 

It's an orkish low-budget build, so some parts will be improvised and changed. 
i.e. no off-the-shelf linear rails - 2020 vertical pillars will be guides. I've built couple machines like this, so it will be working ok.

I don't really like some parts from original models as they are quite fragile and do not really serve for structural stability at all or delaminate easily. 
Updated parts i'll put here.
